                            Good question.  This is the estimated enterprise value of the attraction, 
                            or what someone with a lot of money would pay to take it over.

                            We use comparables in two ways.  
                            <br /><br />
                            The stock market actually assigns an enterprise value for the publicly traded theme park chains every day.  
                            This is the case with Cedar Fair, Disney, and so on.  
                            We assume that the value of a Disney park is likely not that different on any given Wednesday compared to Tuesday, 
                            so our values are average annual values based on the average annual value of the park during the preceding year.  
                            <br /><br />
                            The second method is that every so often, 
                            theme parks are bought and sold.  These deals reveal transaction 
                            multiples that we then apply to parks of a similar nature.

                            This is the exchange rate that calibrates prices from different countries to a common 
                            frame of reference by adjusting for the cost of living.  
                            While there are several different sets of PPP exchange rates in the world, 
                            the ones used in our site are those calculated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  
                            <br /><br />
                            PPP rates are more stable than spot exchange rates which fluctuate daily, 
                            and have the potential to drop or rise for reasons unrelated to the cost of living, 
                            such as trade wars or capital flight.  
                            <br /><br />
                            However, the use of PPP exchange rates is still a matter of some debate!  
                            That is why on our detail page we include native currency references as well.

                            lacks a common point of reference for data or information.
